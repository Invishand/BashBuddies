## Syntax - a non-exhaustive overview

### REGEX ("regular expressions") in sed
#### some common symbols:
- **`^`**: denotes the beginning of something, or a position that precedes another.
- **`.`**: any printable character.
- **`*`**: zero or more of the preceding character(s).
- **`?`**: zero or one of the preceding character(s).
- **`$`**: denotes the end of something, or a position that follows another.
#### some common character-classes
- **`\s`**: a single space or tab (sometimes called "whitespace").
- **`\n`**: a single "newline" (a way of refering to the empty space between lines).
- **`\t`**: a single tab character.

---
### commandline options
- **`-i`**: edit files in place.
- **`-i<SUFFIX>`**: edit files in place after backing them up (creates a copy of <FILE> named <FILE><SUFFIX>).
- **`-n`**: only print where the pattern space is matched.

---
### command modes

#### i - insertion
- **`i<INPUT>`**: insert <INPUT> onto a new line above each line.
- **`<N>i<INPUT>`**: insert <INPUT> onto a new line above line number <N>.

#### d - delete
- **`^\s*$`**:  matches lines that begin with any amount of whitespace followed by end of line
```bash
## omit empty lines from output
sed '/^\s*$/d'

## delete empty lines from file
sed -i '/^\s*$/d' <FILE>
```

### s - search/substitution
- **`s/<a>/<b>/`**: replace first instance of <a> with <b>.
- **`<N>s/<a>/<b>/`**: replace <a> with <b> only on line <N>.

### g - global
- **`s/<a>/<b>/g`**: replace every occurence of <a> with <b>.

### p - print
- **`sed -n <A>,<B>p`**: combined with `-n` to selectively print a line or range of lines (<A> through <B>, for example).
```bash
# only print line number `${number}`
sed -n "${number}p" [<FILE>]

# only print lines `${first}` through `${last}`
sed -n "${first},${last}p" [<FILE>]
```

---
### daisy-chaining sed commands
#### seperator: semicolon
```bash
# replace <a> with <b> and then replace <c> with <d>:
sed 's/<a>/<b>/;s/<c>/<d>/'

# replace <a> with <b> and then replace <c> with <d> in >FILE>:
sed -i 's/<a>/<b>/;s/<c>/<d>/' <FILE>


# seperator: line-break
sed '
	s/replace-these/with-this/
	s/replace-these/with-this/
	...'
sed -i '
	s/replace-first-one-of/with-this/
	s/replace-every-one-of/with-this/g
	...
	' <FILE>
```


---
## NOTES
- **seperator**: if you need to use '/' characters in the regex search pattern, then use '|' as the field seperator.  for example: `'s|replace/this|with/this|'`
- **variables**: if you would like to use variables, wrap the command in " instead of ' .  for example: `"s/${1}/${2}/"`
- **specials**: some special characters must be braced in the search pattern portion of the command.  for example (to remove '\'): `'s/[\\]//'`

## misc/programmatic usage examples

#### housekeeping: a quick explanation of the bash-centric syntax used in the following examples
- **`"$*","${*}","$@","${@}"`**: the array of positional parameters, aka commandline arguments (for subtle differences, see: ["bash handout"](bash_handout.md))
- **`${!#}`**: a ["pointer"](bash_handout.md#pointers) to the final ["positional parameter"](bash_handout.md#positional%20parameters)
- **`${*:2}`**: all ["positional parameters"](bash_handout.md#positional%20parameters) starting from $2
- **`${*:2:$#-2}`**: every ["positional parameter"](bash_handout.md#positional%20parameters) except the first and last
- **`${*:1:$#-1}`**: every ["positional parameter"](bash_handout.md#positional%20parameters) other than the last

## Conditional Logic
In `sed`, the stream editor, conditionals are not structured in the same way as in traditional programming languages like C or Python.
Instead, `sed` uses pattern matching, branching commands, and specific flags to control the flow of execution based on conditions.
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how you can implement conditional logic in `sed`:

### 1. Pattern Matching
The most basic form of conditional in `sed` is direct pattern matching. Commands in `sed` can be prefixed with an address or a pattern, and the command will only execute if the input line matches the pattern.

For example, to delete lines containing the word "error":
```bash
sed '/error/d' file.txt
```

### 2. Branching with `b`, `t`, `T`
`sed` supports basic branching with the `b`, `t`, and `T` commands, which can be used to jump to labels based on conditions.

- **`b` (branch)**: Unconditionally jumps to a label. If no label is specified, it jumps to the end of the script, effectively skipping all remaining commands.
- **`t` (test)**: Branches to a label if the last `s///` (substitute) command made a substitution.
- **`T`**: The opposite of `t`; it branches to a label if the last `s///` command did not make a substitution.

#### Example of `t` and `T`
Here's an example where `t` is used to branch if a substitution is successful:
```bash
sed '/^#/d; s/old/new/; t label; :label; s/example/test/' file.txt
```
This script will delete lines starting with `#`, try to replace "old" with "new", and if the substitution is successful, it jumps to `label` where another substitution happens.

### 3. Using `n` and `N` for Conditional Execution
The `n` and `N` commands can also be part of conditional logic by controlling the flow of input lines into the pattern space.

- **`n`**: Reads the next line of input into the pattern space, replacing the current contents, and starts the next cycle of commands.
- **`N`**: Appends the next line of input to the pattern space along with a newline.

These can be used to conditionally process lines based on their content or order.

### 4. Complex Conditions with `{}` Blocks
You can group commands within `{}` to create more complex conditional blocks. This is useful when you want to execute multiple commands based on a single address or pattern match.

```bash
sed '/pattern/{
  s/find/replace/
  b
  :label
  s/find2/replace2/
}' file.txt
```
In this script, if a line matches `/pattern/`, `sed` performs a substitution, then unconditionally branches to the end of the script (skipping to the next input line), or to a label where another substitution is made.

### 5. Negating Conditions
You can negate a condition using `!`. For example, to execute a command on lines that do not match a pattern:
```bash
sed '/pattern/!d' file.txt
```
This deletes all lines that do not match `/pattern/`.

These examples illustrate the fundamental ways `sed` handles conditional logic, leveraging its pattern space, line addressing, and branching capabilities.
